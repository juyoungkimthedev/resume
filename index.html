                            framework to allow developers to build internal and third-party apps on the payment platform. These apps were the
                            building blocks of the payment platform. Led migration of old apps (not using framework) to the new framework.</li>
                        <li>Maintained and improved existing FastAPI based core API by adding new endpoints, handlers and controllers that
